# Berkley Coding Bootcamp Study Guide

## Description

This project aims to create a starting page where notes related to the Berkeley Coding Bootcamp can be stored and viewed. This page must utilize basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as be uploaded through Git software and deployed online. This project functions as a study guide and an opportunity for myself to become familiarized with basic coding language.

## Installation

## Usage

The page displays textual information for user viewing, and returns information in the console through console.log. Right click the page and select 'inspect', then go to the console window and you will have several topics returned through JavaScript functions. If you refresh the page, one line of text in the console will change to one of four results from a math.random array.
